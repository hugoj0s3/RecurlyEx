# NaturalCron
**NaturalCron** is a lightweight .NET library for writing **human-readable recurrence rules**.
Instead of memorizing cryptic CRON syntax.

## üîÅ Examples of expressions you can write:

- `@every day @at 9:00am` or `every day at 9:00am`
- `@every week @on [Tuesday, Thursday] @at 18:00` or `every week on [Tuesday, Thursday] at 18:00`
- `@every month @on ClosestWeekdayTo 6th` or `every month on ClosestWeekdayTo 6th`
- `@every 25 seconds @between 1:20pm and 01:22pm` or `every 25 seconds between 1:20pm and 01:22pm`

## ‚ú® Features

- Readable, expressive and easy to memorize ‚Äî e.g use `every 5 minutes on friday` instead of `*/5 * * * 5`
- Powerful `between`, `upto`, `from`, and more filtering
- Closest weekday, first/last day handling
- Time zone support with IANA TZ names
- Friendly aliases (`daily`, `hourly`, etc.)

## üì¶ Installation
```bash
dotnet add package NaturalCron
```

## Usage
```csharp
using System;
using NaturalCron;

// Define a recurrence rule using natural language
var recur = NaturalCronExpr.Parse("every 25 min on friday between 1:00pm and 03:00pm");

// Get the next 11 occurrences starting from Jan 1, 2020
var nextOccurrences = recur.TryGetNextOccurrences(
    DateTime.Parse("2020-01-01 00:00:00"), 6
);

foreach (var nextOccurrence in nextOccurrences)
{
    Console.WriteLine(nextOccurrence.ToString("dddd, dd MMMM yyyy HH:mm:ss"));
}

/*
Output:
Friday, 03 January 2020 13:00:00
Friday, 03 January 2020 13:25:00
Friday, 03 January 2020 13:50:00
Friday, 03 January 2020 14:15:00
Friday, 03 January 2020 14:40:00
Friday, 10 January 2020 13:00:00
....
*/
```

## üìö Other Examples

```csharp
// Every 5 minutes on Fridays
var recur1 = NaturalCron.Parse("every 5 min on friday");

// Every 25 seconds between 1:20pm and 1:22pm
var recur2 = NaturalCron.Parse("every 25 seconds between 1:20pm and 1:22pm");

// Every month on the closest weekday to the 6th
var recur3 = NaturalCron.Parse("every month on ClosestWeekdayTo 6th");

// Every day at 9:00 AM
var recur4 = NaturalCron.Parse("every day at 9:00am");

// Every week on Tuesday and Thursday at 18:00
var recur5 = NaturalCron.Parse("every week on [Tuesday, Thursday] at 18:00");
