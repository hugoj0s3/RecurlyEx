# Expression Syntax

NaturalCron supports a simple, human-readable syntax for defining recurring schedules.  
You can use keywords like `every`, `on`, `at`, `between`, `upto`, and `from` to build powerful recurrence rules.

**Note:** 
The `@` prefix is **optional**.

For example:
- `@every day @at 9:00am` or `every day at 9:00am` ✅
---

## Supported Rules
- `every` — Main recurrence interval
- `on`, `in`, `at` — Specific occurrences
- `between` — Range filters
- `upto`, `from` — Boundary filters
- `timezone` or `tz` — Time zone specification
---

## `every` or `@every` — Main Recurrence Interval
Defines how often the recurrence happens.  
The interval must be a positive integer, and the time unit must be one of the supported units.

**Syntax:**
- `every <number> <time-unit>`


**Examples:**
- `every day` — every day
- `every 2 weeks` — every 2 weeks
- `every 6 months` — every 6 months
- `every year` — every year

---

### Anchored Recurrences
The `AnchoredOn` keyword lets you **fix the schedule to a specific anchor point**, useful for fiscal or seasonal rules.

**Syntax:**
- `every <number> <time-unit> AnchoredOn <month|number|week|ordinal day>`

> **Note:** 
> The anchor must be of the same time unit as the recurrence interval (e.g., for `every 2 months`, only months are valid for `AnchoredOn`).

**Examples:**
- `every 2 months AnchoredOn Nov on 1st`  
  → Always runs on the 1st of Nov, Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep.
- `every 6 months AnchoredOn Feb on 1st`  
  → Always runs in Feb and Aug.

**Notes:**
- Only one `every` rule is allowed per expression.
- The interval must be greater than zero (e.g., `every 0 days` is invalid).

### Shortcut Keywords
- `secondly`, `minutely`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`

These are equivalent to `every 1 <time-unit>`:
- `hourly between 09:00 and 17:00`
- `monthly on 1st`

You can use these shortcuts for more concise and readable recurrence expressions.

## `on`, `in`, `at` or `@on`, `@in`, `@at` — Specific Occurrences
Defines when the recurrence happens.

**Syntax:**
- `on <time-unit> <number>`
- `in <time-unit> <number>`
- `at <time-unit> <number>`

For multiple uses bracket the time units and numbers:
- `on [<time-unit> <number>, ...]`
- `in [<time-unit> <number>, ...]`
- `at [<time-unit> <number>, ...]`

**Examples:**
- `on day 10` — on the 10th day of the month or just `on 10th`
- `in month 10` — in december or use `in december` or `in dec`
- `at hour 10 at minute 30` or `at 10:30am` — at 10:30am

**Examples:**
- `on [day 1, day 20, day 30]` or `on [1st, 20th, 30th]` — on the 1st, 20th, and 30th days of the month
- `at [10:00pm, 12:00am]` or `at [22:00, 00:00]` or `at [10:00pm, 12:00am]` — If neither `am` nor `pm` is specified, the time will be interpreted using 24-hour notation by default.
- `on [friday, saturday]` or `on [fri, sat]` — on Friday or Saturday

**Special Days**

- **Closest weekday to a specific day:**  
  `on ClosestWeekdayTo <number>` — Matches the weekday (Monday–Friday) that is closest to the given day of the month.  
  _Example:_ `on ClosestWeekdayTo 15th` — the closest weekday to the 15th of the month.

  **Edge Cases:**
    - If the given day falls on a weekday (Monday–Friday), it is selected directly.
    - If it falls on a Saturday, the engine will select the preceding Friday.
    - If it falls on a Sunday, the engine will select the following Monday.
    - **Special case:** If the first day of the month is a Saturday (`on ClosestWeekdayTo 1st`), the closest weekday is the following Monday (the 3rd of the month).
    - Similarly, if the last day of the month is a Sunday, the closest weekday is the preceding Friday.

  _Examples:_
    - If the 1st of the month is a Saturday, `on ClosestWeekdayTo 1st` matches the 3rd (Monday).
    - If the 1st is a Sunday, it matches the 2nd (Monday).
    - If the 15th is a Saturday, it matches the 14th (Friday).
    - If the 15th is a Sunday, it matches the 16th (Monday).

- **First weekday of the month:**  
  `on FirstWeekday` — Matches the first weekday (Monday–Friday) of the month.  
  _Example:_ `on FirstWeekday`

- **Last weekday of the month:**  
  `on LastWeekday` — Matches the last weekday (Monday–Friday) of the month.  
  _Example:_ `on LastWeekday`

- **First or last day of the month:**  
  You can use any of the following interchangeable keywords to match the first or last day of the month:

    - **Last day of the month:**
        - `on LastDayOfTheMonth`
        - `on LastDayOfMonth`
        - `on LastDay`

    - **First day of the month:**
        - `on FirstOfTheMonth`
        - `on FirstDayOfMonth`
        - `on FirstDay`

  _Examples:_
    - `every month on LastDay` — triggers on the last day of every month.
    - `every month on FirstDayOfMonth` — triggers on the first day of every month.

- **Specific weekday occurrence in the month:**  
  Use numeric or word-based ordinals, and full or abbreviated weekday names. Ordinals from `1st` to `5th` are supported (note: not all months have a 5th occurrence).
    - _Examples:_
        - `on 1stMon`, `on 1stMonday`, `on FirstMon`, `on FirstMonday` — all specify the first Monday of the month.
        - `on 2ndTuesday`, `on ThirdFri`, `on 5thMonday` — specify the second Tuesday, third Friday, or fifth Monday of the month, respectively.

- **Basic arithmetic with day keywords:**  
  The recurrence engine supports simple arithmetic operations (`+` and `-`) with day-based keywords.  
  _Examples:_
    - `on LastDay - 1` — matches the day before the last day of the month (i.e., the second-to-last day).
    - `on FirstDay + 2` — matches the third day of the month.
      It never crosses month boundaries, e.g `on FirstDay + 31` it will match the last day of the month. or `on LastDay - 31` it will match the first day of the month.

**Note:**  
The recurrence engine does not make a strict distinction between `on`, `at`, and `in` when used in expressions.
This design choice is intentional to prioritize flexibility and ease of use. By treating these keywords equivalently, the recurrence engine allows users to write expressions in a way that feels most natural to them, without worrying about strict syntax rules. This approach also simplifies parsing and ensures that the system can accommodate a wide range of user preferences and writing styles.

## `between` or `@between` Between Rules
The `between` rule allows you to restrict occurrences to a specific range—such as a range of days in the month, times within a day, or other supported units.

**Syntax:**
- `<start>` and `<end>` can be days, times, or other supported units/aliases.

**Examples:**
- `every hour between 10th and 15th`  
  Matches only the 10th through 15th day of each hour.
- `every hour between 09:00 and 17:00`  
  Matches only occurrences between 9:00am and 5:00pm each hour.
- `every week between Jun and Dec`  
  Matches weekly occurrences between June and December.
- `every month between 2nd and LastDay`
  Matches only the first through last day of each month.
- `every 25 secs between [1:00pm and 03:00pm, 6:00pm and 8:00pm]`
  Matches only occurrences between 1:00pm and 3:00pm, and 6:00pm and 8:00pm, every 25 seconds.

**Notes:**
- The boundaries in the `between` rule are inclusive. For example, `between 10th and 15th` includes both the 10th and the 15th.
- You can use any supported aliases for days, times, or months in the `between` rule.
- `between` can be combined with other rules (such as `on`, `at`, etc.) for more precise filtering.

## `upto` and `from` or `@upto` and `@from` Rules
The `upto` and `from` rules allow you to restrict occurrences to only those before or after a specific point (such as a time, day, or other supported unit), relative to the recurrence interval.

**Syntax:**
- `upto <value>`
- `from <value>`

`<value>` can be a time, day, or any supported alias (e.g., `upto 13:00`, `after 09:00`, `upto 15th`).

**Examples:**
- `every 10 secs upto 1:00pm`  
  Matches every 10 seconds, including 1:00pm, but only up to and including 1:00pm each 10 seconds.
- `every minute from 18:00`  
  Matches every minute, including 6:00pm, and all times after on each minute.
- `every day upto 15th`  
  Matches all days up to and including the 15th of each month.
- `every hour from 09:00`  
  Matches every hour, starting from and including 9:00am each hour.

**Notes:**
- The boundary value itself is included; for example, `upto 1:00pm` matches up to and including 1:00pm.
- You can use any supported aliases for times, days, or months.
- `upto` and `from` can be combined with other rules (such as `on`, `at`, etc.) for more precise filtering.

## Time Zone Support
You can specify the time zone for your recurrence expressions using either `timezone` or the shorthand `tz`.  
This ensures that all date and time calculations are made in the specified IANA time zone.

**Syntax:**
- `timezone <IANA-timezone>` or `@timezone <IANA-timezone>`
- `tz <IANA-timezone>` or `tz <IANA-timezone>`

**Examples:**
- `every day at 09:00 timezone America/New_York` or `every day at 09:00 tz America/New_York`
- `monthly on 1st tz Asia/Tokyo` or `monthly on 1st tz Asia/Tokyo`

**Notes:**
- The engine uses IANA time zone names (e.g., `America/Los_Angeles`, `Europe/London`).
- Time zone rules affect all time-based calculations, including DST transitions.

## Supported time units and aliases
The following units and their aliases can be used with all relevant rules, such as `every`, `on`, and `between`, as well as `upto` and `from`:

| Unit    | Aliases                            |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| second  | `second`, `sec`, `secs`, `seconds` |
| minute  | `minute`, `min`, `mins`, `minutes` |
| hour    | `hour`, `hr`, `hrs`, `hours`       |
| day     | `day`, `dy`, `days`, `dys`         |
| week    | `week`, `wk`, `weeks`, `wks`       |
| month   | `month`, `mth`, `months`, `mths`   |
| year    | `year`,  `yr`, `years`, `yrs`      |

**Examples:**
- `every 2 weeks`
- `on day 10`
- `between hour 9 and hour 17`
- `on month 12`

You can use any alias interchangeably in your recurrence expressions.

## Specifying Time in Recurrence Expressions
You can specify times in your recurrence expressions using several supported formats. The engine accepts both 12-hour and 24-hour notation, and you can include seconds if needed.

**Supported Time Formats:**
- `2:00pm` — 12-hour clock with `am`/`pm`
- `14:00` — 24-hour clock (hours and minutes)
- `14:00:10` — 24-hour clock with seconds
- `2:00:10pm` — 12-hour clock with seconds and `am`/`pm`

**Examples:**
- `every day at 2:00pm` — triggers at 2:00pm each day
- `every day at 14:00` — triggers at 14:00 (2:00pm) each day
- `every day at 14:00:10` — triggers at 2:00:10pm each day
- `every day at 2:00:10pm` — triggers at 2:00:10pm each day

**Notes:**
- If neither `am` nor `pm` is specified, the time is interpreted as 24-hour format by default.
- Seconds are optional; if omitted, the time matches at the start of the specified minute.
- You can use these formats in any rule that accepts a time value, such as `at`, `on`, `between`, `from`, and `upto`.

## Specifying Dates in Recurrence Expressions

You can specify dates in your recurrence expressions using the following formats:

**Supported Date Formats:**
Ordinal Date (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.):
- `1st` — the first day of the month
- `2nd` — the second day of the month
- `3rd` — the third day of the month
- `4th` — the fourth day of the month
  etc.

Month Name (e.g., January, February, etc.):
- `January` or `Jan`
- `February` or `Feb`
  etc.

Weekday Name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.):
- `Monday` or `Mon`
- `Tuesday` or `Tue`
  etc.

Dashed Separated Date (e.g., 2023-01-23):
- `Jan-23` — January 23rd
- `12-31` — December 31st
- `2023-01-23` — January 23rd, 2023
- `2023-12-31` — December 31st, 2023
- `2023-JAN` — January 2023

Ordinal Day + Month Name (e.g., 1st January, 2nd February, etc.):
- `1st January` or `1st Jan` or `January 1st` or `Jan 1st`
- `2nd February` or `2nd Feb` or `February 2nd` or `Feb 2nd`

Ordinal Day + Month Name + Year (e.g., 1st January 2023, 2nd February 2023, etc.):
- `1st January 2023` or `1st Jan 2023` or `January 1st 2023` or `Jan 1st 2023`
- `2nd February 2023` or `2nd Feb 2023` or `February 2nd 2023` or `Feb 2nd 2023`

Colon + Dashed Separated Date (e.g., 2023-01-23):
it allows the combination of date and time
- `2023-01-23 14:00` — January 23rd, 2023 at 14:00
- `JAN-23 14:00:10` — January 23rd, 2023 at 14:00:10

Colon + ordinal day (e.g. 1st JAN 14:00)
- `1st JAN 14:00` or `1st JAN 14:00:10` or `1st JAN 2:00pm` or `1st JAN 2:00:10pm`

**Note:** 
Commas are ignored in single date expressions but not allowed in bracketed multiple date expressions.
- `on 1st, January` (comma is ignored) ✅
- `on [1st, January]` (invalid syntax in brackets) ❌
